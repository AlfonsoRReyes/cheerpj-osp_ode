## Run

### Remotely (via GitHub)
This assumes you have this folder in GitHub. We will need to change `index.html` file on line 13, as this:
```js
await cheerpjRunJar("/app/cheerpj-osp_ode/osp_ode_examples.jar");
```
where we have added the name of the repository `cheerpj-osp_ode` to the path.

1. Enable **GitHub Pages** for this repository, with *Settings | Pages*; Build and Deployment Source: **Deploy from a branch**;  Branch: `main / root`
2. Wait few seconds until the build finishes. You will see a web address at GitHub Pages. Something like this: `https://username/github.io/cheerpj-osp_ode/`
3. Wait few seconds for *cheerpJ* to build the application
